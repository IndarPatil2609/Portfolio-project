<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am Indar Patil and persuing the BTech degree who will soon be entering in the final year of the Btech. I want to become the web developer and currently learning the same and i guess doing great from past few weeks as i am tring to do some project. It really feels good to express our learning in the project by yourself and succeeding in it with good output. I am trying this portfolio project as a practice and will try do projects with more complexity.
